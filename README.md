# Raman Spectral Analysis for Alpha-Synuclein Fibrillation Assay

## Overview
This repository contains the code for analysing Raman spectral data collected during the alpha-synuclein fibrillation assay. 
The analysis includes data preprocessing, normalization, PCA, UMAP visualization, and supervised learning using Random Forest models.

Features
- Normalizes Raman spectral data using SNV normalization.
- Generates various visualizations, including PCA plots, UMAP plots, and heatmaps.
- Performs statistical analysis such as ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Dunn's tests.
- Implements supervised learning with Random Forest to classify groups.

Repository Contents
- `main.R`: Core script for running the analysis.
- `Data/`: Placeholder directory for .csv and .xlsx files (not included in the repository due to privacy or size constraints).
- `Figures/`: Example output plots generated by the script (not included, but paths are provided in the script).
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories excluded from version control (e.g., temporary RStudio files, data outputs).
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for this repository.


Installation - Prerequisites
R version 4.0 or higher.
RStudio (optional but recommended).
Required Libraries;
 dplyr
 openxlsx
 reshape2
 ggplot2
 RamanMP
 factoextra
 randomForest
 caret
 umap
 cowplot
 
Install the libraries with the following command:
install.packages(c("dplyr", "openxlsx", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "factoextra", "randomForest", "caret", "umap", "cowplot", "RamanMP"))

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git


Usage
1. Data Preparation
Place your Raman spectral .xlsx or .csv files in the working directory.
Ensure the files are formatted as described in the script comments (e.g., columns for freq and intensity values).
2. Running the Script
Open the script (main.R) in RStudio.
Adjust file paths in the script to match your local directory structure.
Run the entire script or sections as needed.
3. Outputs
Plots: PCA, UMAP, and spectral intensity plots.
Statistical Results: ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn’s test, and random forest classification metrics.
Files: Normalised spectral data saved as .xlsx or .csv files.



Data Files
This project relies on Raman spectral data provided as .xlsx or .csv files. These files are not included in the repository due to size or privacy constraints. 
Below is a description of the required structure and expected content of the data files:

Input Data (e.g., ProteinLB.xlsx):

Columns:
freq: Contains the wavenumber values (in cm⁻¹) for Raman spectra.
Other columns represent intensity values for different samples or time points.
Format:
Ensure the first column is freq, followed by sample columns (e.g., day_0, day_1, day_4, day_7).
Example:
freq    day_0   day_1   day_4   day_7
600     1.23    1.45    1.56    1.78
601     1.34    1.49    1.61    1.85
...

Normalized Output Data:
Files such as Protein_result.xlsx are generated during the script’s execution.
These files contain normalized spectral data (e.g., using SNV normalization).

Optional Grouping Files (e.g., Grouping_Data.csv):
Columns:
Sample: Identifies each sample (e.g., Sample 1, Sample 2).
Group: Indicates the group/category of the sample (e.g., Day 0, Day 1, Control, Treated).
Purpose:
Used for supervised learning or clustering in PCA/UMAP.
Example:
Group    Sample
0          1
0          2
1          3
1          4
2          5
2          6
3          7
3          8
